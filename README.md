Cool, I checked out your GitHub repo. I can suggest specific changes to your **README.md** to match your project‚Äôs updated flow (voice once per question, speech-to-text, submission, summary), plus make it more polished. Here‚Äôs an updated version you can replace in your repo or merge:

# üß† AI Interviewer ‚Äì Excel Edition

An AI-powered Excel Interviewer built using Streamlit + HuggingFace Embeddings.  
You will be asked Excel-related questions via voice; you respond via speech; the system evaluates your answer through similarity matching and gives feedback, then finally a summary of topics you could improve.

---

## üéØ Features

- The interviewer speaks the question **once**, then waits for your response.  
- Your answer is captured via browser mic, transcribed to text.  
- AI compares your answer with the expected one using embeddings + cosine similarity.  
- You receive interviewer-style feedback (positive or constructive) based on how close you were.  
- After all questions, a summary of topics needing improvement is shown.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```

Ai\_Interviewer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py               # Main application logic (question ask, speech capture & processing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Dependencies for easy install
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation (Local)

1. Clone your repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KHITOLIA/Ai_Interviewer.git
   cd Ai_Interviewer
````

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## üó£Ô∏è Usage Workflow

1. When you open the app, the interviewer will **speak the first question** out loud (once).
2. When ready, click the mic/record button and speak your answer.
3. Submit the answer. The app will transcribe your speech, compute similarity with the expected answer, and provide feedback.
4. The same process repeats for subsequent questions.
5. At the end, you‚Äôll see a **summary of topics** that your answers were weaker on.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

1. Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub (your latest version with voice-once, speech-to-text + summary).
2. Ensure `requirements.txt` is updated with all required libraries.
3. Go to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io), login with your GitHub.
4. Create a **New app** ‚Üí Select your repository `KHITOLIA/Ai_Interviewer`, main branch, `app.py` as the entry point.
5. Click **Deploy**. Wait a few minutes.
6. Once live, you'll get a URL like `https://<your-username>-ai-interviewer.streamlit.app`. Share it or use it.

---

## üìù Example `requirements.txt`

Here is an example of what yours should have (based on your code):

```
streamlit
numpy
scikit-learn
langchain-huggingface
sentence-transformers
SpeechRecognition
gTTS
st_audiorec
```

> Note: If you‚Äôre using a widget that directly gives you WAV bytes (like `st_audiorec`) then you may not need libraries like `pydub` or `ffmpeg` if you avoid them.

---

## üîç Future Improvements

* Add more Excel questions/dynamic question bank.
* Better error handling when speech is not clear or user didn‚Äôt speak.
* Live transcription display during speech (speech-as-you-speak).
* Responsiveness / mobile compatibility.
* Support for more languages or accents.
